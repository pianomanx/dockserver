## Advanced, lightweight Torrent client

### INSTALLATION NOTES: 

 In order for it to work with sonarr/radarr downloads that are compressed, you need to install the extractor module

*Preferences -> Plugins ->* **tick off label and extractor**:tw-2714:

*In the extractor section, tick off* **"create torrent name sub-folder"**:tw-2714:

Set it to: **/mnt/downloads/torrent**

Now sonarr/radarr can grab the extracted files. 

**Deluge is set to only seed 4 torrents per default. If your provider is seeding-sensetive you might wanna look into that under preferences->bandwith->upload slots **
