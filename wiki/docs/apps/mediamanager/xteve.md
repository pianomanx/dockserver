## xTeve is a M3U Proxy for Plex DVR and Emby Live TV
***use ( http://xteve:34400 ) for in-app communication***

#### **Install Notes:**
Access interface will be published on https://xteve.domain.com/web - Accessing xteve.domain.com will throw an XML error

#### Settings to edit in xTeve: 
-Playlist (add yours)
-EPG source (unless you use the one in Plex)
-Settings -> Buffer -> Xteve -> Buffer size 8MB

When setting it up in plex: 
-Add **xteve:34400** as tuner
-If you want to use the EPG from XTEVE (XEPG) the link you set in Plex **must** be 
http://xteve:34400/xmltv/xteve.xml

Protip: Manage,modulate and shorten your m3u link on www.m3u4u.com - They also have an excellent EPG & Playlist editor
#### 
##Best Practice for Plex/Xteve:

 The output from your provider **MUST** be MPEG-TS(.ts) - make sure that this is set both at your provider and at m3u4u.com. Otherwise plex will drop the streams when the framerates drop in the streams.
